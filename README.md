# PhenoID
A framework to identify and explore cellular phenotypes in human organoids using a flow cytometry antibody panel.  

Contains scripts for:
1. Reading in and preprocessing: transforming, aligning and normalizing flow cytometry data
2. Clustering and data visualization
3. Visualize and summarize expression levels in clusters
4. Identification of cluster markers: Differential gene expression.
5. Cell and cluster annotation using correlation to a reference matrix.
6. Apply cell phenotypes across experiments using Random forest classifier.
7. Comparision between clusters from different datasets and clustering methods.

Workbooks with data analysis.
